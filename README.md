Floppy Birb is a simple 2D game inspired by Flappy Bird, built using Unity. The game challenges players to navigate a small bird through a series of pipes by tapping the spacebar to flap its wings.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Press **Spacebar** to make the bird flap.
- Avoid colliding with the pipes.
- Score points by successfully passing through the gaps.
- If the bird hits a pipe or goes off the screen, the game is over.
- Click the **Restart** button to play again.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Since only the **Assets/** folder and the **current_version.exe** have been uploaded, this repository mainly serves as a resource archive for assets used in development.

- **Assets/** → Contains sprites, sounds, and other assets used in the game.  
- **Floppy Birb.exe** → The latest playable build of Floppy Birb.  

> 🔹 The Unity project files (such as `ProjectSettings/`, `Packages/`, and `Library/`) are not included. If you want to modify the game in Unity, you'll need to create a new Unity project and import the assets manually.

## 🔧 Running the Game
1. **Download** `Floppy Birb.exe` from this repository.
2. **Run** the executable to play the game (Windows only).

## 📝 To-Do List

🔲 End game if the bird flies off the screen.  
🔲 Fix bug where score still increases after game over.  
🔲 Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and game over.  
🔲 Implement a **Particle System** for clouds.
